## 🔍 Introduction

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide 🌍. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various clinical parameters. The predictions can assist in early detection and treatment. ❤️

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical attributes. It is sourced from a publicly available heart disease dataset.

### Features 📋
- **🧓 Age**: Age of the individual  
- **👨‍⚕️ Sex**: Gender (1 = Male, 0 = Female)  
- **💔 Chest Pain Type**: Type of chest pain experienced  
- **💉 Resting Blood Pressure**: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)  
- **🍔 Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)  

## 💻 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python  
- 📒 Jupyter Notebook  
- 🔢 NumPy  
- 🐼 Pandas  
- 📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- 🤖 Scikit-learn  

## 🚀 Workflow

1. **📥 Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Normalize numerical features

2. **🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Statistical summaries
   - Correlation analysis
   - Data visualization

3. **⚙️ Model Building**:
   - Train/test split
   - Fit models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
   - Hyperparameter tuning

4. **📊 Evaluation**:
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion matrix and ROC curves
